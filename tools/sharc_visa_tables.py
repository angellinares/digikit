"""SHARC+ instruction forms for tools/sharc_disasm.py, from tools/sharcspec/decode_table.json.

decode_table.json is built from the public ADI manuals: the SHARC+ Core
Programming Reference Rev 1.5, checked against the classic SHARC Programming
Reference Rev 2.4 (tools/sharcspec/README.md, docs/sharc/SOURCES.md). It
replaces this file's earlier transcription of Rev 1.4, whose `15b` entry
fixed 3 bits where the manual fixes 7.

Memory holds 16-bit little-endian words; a 32- or 48-bit instruction stores
its most significant word first. decode_table.json gives each form's mask and
value MSB-aligned in a 48-bit frame, frame = (w0 << 32) | (w1 << 16) | w2.
TYPES renumbers them onto each form's own width, so bit width-1 is the MSB of
the first word. decode() picks a form as tools/sharcspec/sharc_decode.py
does: among the matching forms, the longest run of fixed bits from bit 47
wins, then the most fixed bits; a tie is ambiguous.

TYPES entries: name (the form name without "Type", e.g. "15b", "8a_abs",
"5b_move"), bits, opcode_mask and opcode_value (own width), frame_mask and
frame_value (48-bit frame), fields {label: (hi, lo)} (own width), lead (fixed
bits from the top of the frame), fixed_bits, uncertain (the table marks some
fixed bits unconfirmed) and source.
