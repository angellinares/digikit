"""Which SHARC+ instructions can write a given DM byte address.

    uv run python tools/sharcwriters.py TARGET [--image dt2-1.16]
        [--width N] [--stack LO:HI] [--json OUT]
        [--max-steps N] [--max-states N] [--jobs N] [--min-depth N]

TARGET is a DM byte address (e.g. 0x252658). The tool:

1. **Census** -- decodes every aligned instruction in the image's code
   blocks (tools/sharcinv.py CODE_BLOCKS, sharcflow.aligned/merge_fields)
   and, from decoded fields alone (no SLEIGH, no execution), finds every
   instruction that can store to DM: forms 15a/15b/3a/3b/3c/3d/4a/4b/4d/
   6a_mem/14a/14d store when their merged d==1 and g==0 (per
   tools/sharcspec/decode_table.json's own field list for each form --
   Type3c's `d` is a real variable bit, not fixed; sharcinv.py's own
   MEM_FORMS omits Type3c even though it stores exactly like the others,
   so this module keeps its own form table rather than reusing that one);
   16a/16b always store, DM when g==0 (no d bit); dual-memory 1a/1b store
   on the DM side when dmd==1, independent of the PM side's own pmd bit.

2. **Resolve** -- groups the census by owning function (tools/sharcinv.py's
   own function recovery, via tools/sharcfn.py's load_context/
   build_inventory: return-delimited spans split at interior call
   targets), then runs tools/sharc_trace.py's forward abstract interpreter
   once per function from its entry, with every I/M/B/L register seeded as
   its own named symbol (`@I3e` etc, so an unresolved address survives as
   e.g. `Affine(I6e - 12)` instead of collapsing to Unknown) and
   concrete_memory=True (so loads from loader-initialised data resolve to
   a Const). Every census store's resolved address is pulled from the
   matching 'store' event(s) in the returned states' traces at that PC.

3. **Classify** -- HIT / EXCLUDED-CONST / EXCLUDED-STACK / STACK-RELATIVE /
   LOADED-POINTER / ENTRY-RELATIVE / UNRESOLVED, from the resolved address,
   the store's width and the target (see classify_store_address). Every
   census DM store gets exactly one class; the class totals always sum to
   the census total (checked at the end of every run).

Stack bounds (Phase 1, docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md, "The
SHARC code is not one block" section and the reset-stack-setup evidence
this tool's own header records): DEFAULT_STACK_LO/HI. Pass --stack LO:HI
to override; omit bounds entirely (not supported via CLI, only
programmatically as stack_lo=None) to fall back every otherwise-excludable
stack-relative store to STACK-RELATIVE instead of EXCLUDED-STACK.

The interpreter-independent logic (the census form rules, the width
tables, and the address classifier) is pure and unit-tested in
tests/test_sharcwriters.py with synthetic decoded fields and synthetic
trace events -- no firmware required. Running the CLI needs the DT2 1.16
SHARC loader (out/sections/dt2-1.16/section_7_BLOB.bin), which is not
committed (see CLAUDE.md).

# (40) starts at 0x282c0000. Nothing in the loader -- no real block, no
# FILL block -- covers the 0x51000-byte span between them, so the image
# never asserts a value for it: it is available RAM, not the tail of any

#
# Corroborating, and tighter: the startup routine blk88@0x1c0f24 (base_sw

# (`MODE1 = set(MODE1, 0x1011800)`). No BIT CLR in the image touches
# CBUFEN and no immediate or memory load writes MODE1 itself. With CBUFEN
# set, post-modify accesses through I7/I6 wrap inside [B7, B7+L7*4) =
# [0x26f000, 0x26f7f4) (PRM p.6-25), and MODIFY wraps whenever L != 0
# regardless of CBUFEN (PRM p.6-7). The gap bound above is kept as the
# default because it needs no assumption about B7, which blk93 recomputes
# from I7 at runtime (sw 0x1c1463/0x1c1472). docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-
# and-startup.md records I6=0x26f7e0 in one traced run, inside both bounds.

# --- resolve: seeding and event selection -----------------------------------

# with "@I6e" so an unresolved address survives as Affine(I6e - 12, ...)
# instead of collapsing to Unknown. R registers are deliberately left
# unseeded (Unknown until something computes them).
#
# L registers are the one deliberate deviation from "seed every I/M/B/L
# register symbolically": tools/sharc_trace.py's Type19a_scaled MODIFY
# handler (its own circular-buffering model) only takes the cheap linear
# path when the destination's L register is a *Const* zero; a merely
# symbolic L (this tool's own @L*e, which could stand for any value
# including nonzero) makes it refuse and return Unknown("scaled circular
# modify I%d"), which then poisons every later use of that I register --
# observed directly: on a full run this was the single largest UNRESOLVED
# reason (the poisoned expression itself, e.g. "I7 + M7 * 4", with no
# "memory-address " prefix so it is not even recognized as
# LOADED-POINTER). L is 0 (circular buffering off) for every DAG register
# at reset (SHARC+ PRM, "Circular Buffering Mode") and this tool's own
# Phase 1 scan of every literal ureg load in the image (see
# DEFAULT_STACK_LO/HI's docstring) found exactly one register the image
# ever loads a nonzero L into: L7 (0x1fd, for the stack). Seeding every L
# with the real, evidence-backed reset default therefore recovers the
# same "Affine, not Unknown" outcome the symbolic I/M/B seeding is for,
# instead of silently defeating it.

# L3, L4 and L15 do NOT qualify despite the same blk88 startup zero:
# blk93 (the main program, reachable at runtime, not just startup) moves
# L3 and L4 from M4 (sw 0x1c508e/0x1c52a3 and 0x1c50c0/0x1c52d5) -- M4 is
# the single most-written register in the image (364 writer sites, dozens
# of distinct immediates), so L3/L4 do not stay 0 -- and loads L15 from
# two fixed DM addresses via Type14a (sw 0x1cc194, 0x1cc478) that are
# nowhere near any RAM region this tool knows about.
#
# B7 does NOT qualify despite its own clean blk88 startup immediate
# (0x26f000, the same value the module's DEFAULT_STACK_LO evidence above
# relies on for the *stack bounds*, a different and unrelated use):
# blk93 recomputes it from I7 via 7d ACONV at sw 0x1c1463/0x1c1472, so it
# does not hold 0x26f000 for the life of the program. Every other B
# register fails the same way (moves or ACONV writes in blk93 or blk56)
# or has multiple, unreconciled reg-indexed-load writers with no proof
# they agree. I6 and I7 -- the sanity check -- both fail hard: I6 has 60
# writer sites (it is the frame pointer), I7 has 20 beyond its own startup
# immediate, including ACONV and moves in blk93.
